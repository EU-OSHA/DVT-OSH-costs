This would contribute also to a more balanced public and private policies and on the urgency of measures to be taken. Ideally it would support in setting priorities in our quest for zero harm at work. The outcome was expected to be  a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and monetary values originating from neglected safety and health measure by region, country, and by selected injuries, illnesses or disorders at work.
