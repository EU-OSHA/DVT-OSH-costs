        <h1>European Parliament pilot project on health and safety of older workers</h1>

        <p>The European Commission concluded a delegation agreement with EU-OSHA to carry out a pilot project on the health and safety of older workers.</p>

        <p>The delegation agreement is based on the decision and request of the European Parliament described in the <a href="http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/official-journal-of-the-european-union-l-56-29.02.2012-pbFXAL12056/downloads/FX-AL-12-056-EN-C/FXAL12056ENC_002.pdf?FileName=FXAL12056ENC_002.pdf&SKU=FXAL12056ENC_PDF&CatalogueNumber=FX-AL-12-056-EN-C" target="_blank">Official Journal of the European Communities 29.02.2012 Chapter 0404—Employment, Social Solidarity and Gender Equality, II/230 - II/231</a></p>

        <p>The pilot project “Safer and healthier work at any age – occupational safety and health (OSH) in the context of an ageing workforce” began in June 2013 and ran until the end of January 2016.</p>

        <p>The objective of the European Parliament was to further investigate possible ways of improving the health and safety of older people at work as the ageing workforce will have a serious financial impact on workers, employers and taxpayers. Therefore the project aims to assess the prerequisites for OSH strategies and systems to take account of an ageing workforce and ensure better prevention for all throughout working life. The results  aim to assist policy development and provide examples of successful and innovative practices. In doing so, the work highlights what works well, what needs to be done or prioritised and identifies the main drivers and obstacles to effective implementation of policy initiatives in this area. The project builds on existing European projects on sustainable work, for example, that of <a href="https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/topics/sustainable-work" target="_blank">Eurofound.</a></p>
        <h2>Reports produced under the project:</h2>
        <ul><li><span>Safer and healthier work at any age - Research review on ageing and OSH</span> &ndash; carried out by desk research that reviewed existing information regarding the topics.</li>

            <li><span >Safer and healthier work at any age - Analysis report on EU and Member States policies, strategies and programme</span>s &ndash; the report addresses the challenges of an ageing workforce in the field of OSH and policy areas that affect it, such as employment and social affairs, public health and education.&nbsp;</li>

            <li><span >Safer and healthier work at any age - Final overall analysis report</span> &ndash; the report combines the findings of the project and includes policy pointers and recommendations aimed at different levels and types of audience.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The various analysis reports and the final overall analysis report are for submission to the European Commission. According to the EP’s decision, the aim of the project was to allow the Commission to assess the appropriateness of a preparatory action with a view to putting in place a Union instrument.</p>

        <h2>Stakeholder Conference</h2>
        <p>At the final stage of the project, a stakeholder conference took place on the 22nd of September 2015 in Brussels. This conference presented the main findings and conclusions from the project to an audience of Member State and European level policy makers.</p>
